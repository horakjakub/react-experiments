Reconcilliation 

1. React builds a Fiber tree which reflects state of current React elements tree
2. Fiber three is mutable and it's role is to be updated, alongside with React three 
3. Fiber nodes are layer of abstraction between DOM (for ReactDOM) and React
4. Fiber nodes contain info about few things like: type of React Element (class), link to corresponding DOM node, 
props state and links to other fiber nodes 
5. Render process starts with reconcilliation mechanism:
durign reconcelliation there is new Fiber tree created based on old one - this tree is called WorkInProgress tree
